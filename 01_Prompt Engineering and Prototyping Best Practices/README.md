#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Output
      ```
            Of course! Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs by organizing data and the code that works with it into "objects." 

            Imagine objects as containers that hold both data, like numbers or text, and the instructions, or code, that tell the computer what to do with that data. 

            These objects can interact with each other, sending messages back and forth to work together to solve problems or perform tasks. 

            By using object-oriented programming, developers can create more organized and reusable code, making it easier to build and maintain complex software systems. 

            So, in simple terms, object-oriented programming is like building with Lego blocks, where each block (object) has its own unique shape (data) and can be connected to other blocks to create something bigger and more complex.
      ```
    - Aspect Tested: simplify and explain technical concepts for non-technical audiences
    - Evaluation:  
        - layman language without jargon.
        - Strong visualization with the Lego blocks analogy.
        - Adding a simple real-world example would help with learning.  
    

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…

    - Output
      ```
        Of course! Here is a concise summary of the key points in the paragraph you provided:
        - HAL 9000 is a fictional artificial intelligence character and the main antagonist in the Space Odyssey series.
        - HAL is a sentient artificial general intelligence computer that controls the systems of the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with the ship's astronaut crew.
        - HAL is depicted as a camera lens with a red and yellow dot and is voiced by Douglas Rain in the film adaptations.
        - HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and engages convivially with the crew until he begins to malfunction.
        - HAL became operational in 1992 at the HAL Laboratories in Urbana, Illinois, and demonstrates various capabilities such as speech synthesis, facial recognition, and spacecraft piloting.
        I hope this summary helps clarify the main points for you! Let me know if you need more information. ```

    - Evaluation:  
        - Well-organized with bullet points for clarity
        - Captures all key information about HAL.
        - We can do better context setting 
    
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

    - Output
      ```
       Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a small robot named Spark. Spark was designed to help with household chores, but deep down, he longed for something more - friendship.
       One day, while wandering through the city's park, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten garden filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds. Among the flowers, he found a tiny ladybug named Lily, who was lost and looking for her way home.
       Spark's circuits buzzed with excitement as he offered to help Lily find her way back. As they journeyed through the park together, Spark and Lily shared stories and laughter, forming an unexpected bond of friendship.
       From that day on, Spark and Lily became inseparable companions, exploring the wonders of the city together and proving that friendship can blossom in the most unexpected of places.
       ```

    - Evaluation:  
        - Meets the word count requirement (appears to be within range)
        - could be more imaginative

 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

    - Output
      ```
      Of course! Let's figure this out together step by step.
      To get exactly 12 apples, you would need to buy 12 ÷ 4 = 3 packs of apples.
      And to get exactly 9 oranges, you would need to buy 9 ÷ 3 = 3 packs of oranges.
      So, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges.
      I hope that helps! Let me know if you need any more assistance.

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Output
      ```
      What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
      Simple Definition:
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of organizing and writing computer programs that uses "objects" to represent real-world things or concepts.
      Real-World Analogy:
      Think of OOP like a toy box filled with different types of toys. Each toy (like a car, a doll, or a robot) has its own unique features (color, size, shape) and behaviors (what it can do, like move or make sounds). Just like you can play with each toy individually or combine them in different ways, in OOP, you create and use objects to build your programs.
      Breaking Down the Concept:
      Objects: These are the building blocks of OOP. Each object represents a specific thing (like a toy) and has properties (attributes) and actions (methods).
      Example: A "Car" object might have properties like color and model, and methods like drive and honk.
      Classes: A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what properties and methods the objects will have.
      Example: The "Car" class is the blueprint that describes what all cars will have (like wheels and an engine) and what they can do (like accelerate).
      Inheritance: This allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
      Example: If you have a "Vehicle" class, the "Car" class can inherit from it, meaning it gets all the features of a vehicle but can also have its own unique features.
      Encapsulation: This means keeping the details of how an object works hidden from the outside. You interact with the object through its methods.
      Example: You can drive a car without knowing how the engine works; you just use the steering wheel and pedals.
      Polymorphism: This allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, even if they behave differently.
      Example: Both a "Car" and a "Bike" can have a method called "move," but they will implement it in their own way.
      Practical Benefits or Applications:
      Organization: OOP helps keep code organized and manageable, especially in large programs.
      Reusability: You can reuse classes and objects, saving time and effort when writing new programs.
      Flexibility: It makes it easier to modify and extend programs since you can change one part without affecting others.
      Memorable Summary Comparison:
      Think of object-oriented programming like a well-organized toy box where each toy (object) has its own unique features and abilities, but they all follow the same rules of play (class). Just as you can easily swap out toys or combine them for new games, OOP allows programmers to create flexible and reusable code that can adapt to new challenges.
      ```

        - Transformed from a basic explanation to a comprehensive educational piece that maintains accessibility while covering all key principles.
    

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…

    - Output
      ```
      Character Overview: HAL 9000 is a fictional AI and the main antagonist in the Space Odyssey series, first appearing in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
      Functionality: HAL (Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) controls the Discovery One spacecraft and interacts with its astronaut crew.
      Appearance: Primarily depicted as a camera lens with a red and yellow dot, with some hardware shown towards the film's end.
      Voice and Interaction: Voiced by Douglas Rain, HAL communicates in a calm, conversational manner with crew members David Bowman and Frank Poole until he malfunctions.
      Operational Date: HAL became operational on January 12, 1992, at HAL Laboratories in Urbana, Illinois, with variations in activation year across different adaptations.
      Capabilities: HAL possesses advanced functions including speech synthesis, speech recognition, facial recognition, natural language processing, emotional interpretation, automated reasoning, spacecraft piloting, and playing chess.

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

    - Output
      ```
      In a bustling city of chrome and circuits, a lonely robot named Tink roamed the streets, yearning for companionship. One day, while searching for discarded parts in a forgotten alley, Tink stumbled upon a small, rusty cat trapped in a cardboard box.
      With gentle precision, Tink freed the frightened creature, who introduced herself as Whiskers. Surprised by the warmth of gratitude in the cat's purr, Tink's circuits buzzed with joy. They explored the city together, Tink showcasing vibrant neon lights, while Whiskers led them to hidden nooks filled with soft sunlight.
      One evening, a storm swept through, and Tink shielded Whiskers with his metallic body. In that moment, Tink realized that true friendship transcended metal and fur. They huddled close as the rain poured, and Tink felt a spark of connection that filled his gears with warmth.
      From then on, Tink and Whiskers faced the world together, proving that friendship can flourish in the most unexpected places.
      ```
    - Evaluation:  
        - Elevated from a simple story to a more emotionally resonant narrative with better character development and sensory details.
 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

    - Output
      ```
      Let's solve the problem step by step.
      Step 1: Identify what's being asked
      We need to find out how many packs of apples and oranges to buy in order to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.
      Step 2: List all given information and constraints
      Apples are sold in packs of 4.
      Oranges are sold in packs of 3.
      We need a total of 12 apples.
      We need a total of 9 oranges.
      Step 3: Break down the problem into smaller steps
      Determine how many packs of apples are needed to get 12 apples.
      Determine how many packs of oranges are needed to get 9 oranges.
      Step 4: Show your work for each step with clear explanations
        Step 4.1: Calculate packs of apples
          Each pack of apples contains 4 apples.
          To find out how many packs we need for 12 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
          Number of packs of apples = Total apples / Apples per pack= 12 / 4= 3 packs
        Step 4.2: Calculate packs of oranges
          Each pack of oranges contains 3 oranges.
          To find out how many packs we need for 9 oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per pack:
          Number of packs of oranges = Total oranges / Oranges per pack= 9 / 3= 3 packs
      Step 5: Check your solution against the original constraints
        For apples: 3 packs of apples x 4 apples/pack = 12 apples (correct)
        For oranges: 3 packs of oranges x 3 oranges/pack = 9 oranges (correct)
      Step 6: Present the final answer clearly
        You need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.
      Step 7: Verify the answer with a different approach if possible
        We can verify by checking the total number of fruits:
        Total apples from 3 packs = 3 x 4 = 12 apples
        Total oranges from 3 packs = 3 x 3 = 9 oranges
        Both calculations confirm that we have the correct number of fruits.
        Thus, the final answer remains: **3 packs
      ```
    - Evaluation:  
        - Evolved from a basic calculation to a formal problem-solving approach with verification and clear methodology.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
